About This Graduate Design
-----------------
**I'm majoring micro-electronic at [The North University Of China][1].**     

You may already see that,this project is my **Graduate Design** which written in **ANSI C langauge** and based on the **IDE of Labwindows/CVI**.  

And believe me,this is my first time to make contact with the C programming language.So the code I wrote down may looks a little bit unprofessional,and you can just ignore them.

**If you are one of the students of [NUC][1], I surely know why you are here** (tittering), and this is partly the reason I decide to publish it.  

Another reason why I published this project was that I hoped my work --which cost me almost one month-- could be stored somewhere, other than once it's done you never care about it anymore.

This project's **Entry Point** lies in the ***[MainCode.c][2]*** file,and almost all the code I wrote lies in this files,too.
